# Smart-Medibox
This project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller, a DHT sensor, an OLED display, and a buzzer to create a medicine container that measures temperature and humidity, notifies the user, and sets an alarm for medication times. Additionally, a Node-RED based web application is available for real-time data monitoring and setting alarms.
